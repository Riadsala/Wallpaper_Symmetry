  abstract = {A traditional line of work starting with the Gestalt school has shown that patterns vary in strength and salience; a difference in “Perceptual goodness.” The Holographic weight of evidence model quantifies goodness of visual regularities. The key formula states that W = E/N, where E is number of holographic identities in a pattern and N is number of elements. We tested whether W predicts the amplitude of the neural response to regularity in an extrastriate symmetry-sensitive network. We recorded an Event Related Potential (ERP) generated by symmetry called the Sustained Posterior Negativity (SPN). First, we reanalyzed the published work and found that W explained most variance in SPN amplitude. Then in four new studies, we confirmed specific predictions of the holographic model regarding 1) the differential effects of numerosity on reflection and repetition, 2) the similarity between reflection and Glass patterns, 3) multiple symmetries, and 4) symmetry and anti-symmetry. In all cases, the holographic approach predicted SPN amplitude remarkably well; particularly in an early window around 300–400 ms post stimulus onset. Although the holographic model was not conceived as a model of neural processing, it captures many details of the brain response to symmetry.},

  abstract = {Goodness is a classic Gestalt notion defined as salience or perceptual strength of a given pattern. All operational models of goodness have assigned a central role to mirror symmetry but not much attention has been paid to the distinction between global and local mirror symmetry, and their possible interactions. We designed eight different types of dot patterns (all consisting of 80 dots), combining different numbers (0, 1, and 2) and relative orientations (parallel or orthogonal to each other) of local and global axes of symmetry (affecting 50\% or 100\% of the dots, respectively) at different absolute orientations (vertical and horizontal). Each of 640 trials consisted of a short presentation of a new dot pattern, which subjects had to classify as regular or random. We hypothesised that the overall goodness of patterns is not the simple sum of the amount of regularity present in them but depends on the cooperation and competition between symmetries. The results confirmed our hypothesis, showing that performance in this regularity-detection task did not increase in a linear way when some symmetries were added to other symmetries.},

  abstract = {Until recently, the transformational approach provided the only available formal analysis of visual regularities like repetition and mirror symmetry. This theoretical study presents a new analysis, based on the recently developed concept of holographic regularity. This concept applies to the intrinsic character of regularity and specifies the unique formal status of perceptually relevant regularities. The crucial point is that the two analyses imply the same structure for repetition but a different structure for mirror symmetry. Transformationally, mirror symmetry is an all-or-nothing property, whereas holographically, it is a graded property. This difference pervades the understanding of both perfect regularities and perturbed regularities. Whereas the transformational approach explains hardly any goodness phenomenon, the holographic approach explains a wide variety of goodness phenomena in a coherent way that is ecologically plausible as well.

Visual symmetry is a useful tool to study gestalt formation, and we know that there are symmetry-sensitive regions in the extrastriate cortex. However, it is unclear whether symmetrical gestalt formation happens automatically, whatever the participant's current task is. Does the visual brain always organize and interpret the retinal image when possible, or only when necessary? To test this, we recorded an ERP called the sustained posterior negativity (SPN). SPN amplitude increases with the proportion of symmetry in symmetry + noise displays. We compared the SPN across five tasks with different cognitive and perceptual demands. Contrary to our predictions, the SPN was the same across four of the five tasks but selectively enhanced during active regularity discrimination. Furthermore, during regularity discrimination, the SPN was present on hit trials and false alarm trials but absent on miss and correct rejection trials. We conclude that gestalt formation is automatic and task-independent, although it occasionally fails on miss trials. However, it can be enhanced by attention to visual regularity.},

  abstract = {Neuroimaging work has shown that visual symmetry activates extrastriate brain areas, most consistently the lateral occipital complex (LOC). LOC activation increases with proportion of symmetrical dots (pSymm) in a degraded display. In the current work, we recorded a posterior ERP called the sustained posterior negativity (SPN), which is relatively negative for symmetrical compared to random patterns. We predicted that SPN would also scale with pSymm, because it is probably generated by the LOC. Twenty-four participants viewed dot patterns with different levels of regularity: 0\% regularity (full random configuration) 20\%, 40\%, 60\%, 80\%, and 100\% (full reflection symmetry). Participants judged if the pattern contained “some regularity” or “no regularity”. As expected, the SPN amplitude increased with pSymm, while the latency and duration was the same in all conditions. The SPN was independent of the participant’s decision, and it was present on some trials where people reported ‘no-regularity’. We conclude that the SPN is generated at an intermediate stage of visual processing, probably in the LOC, where perceptual goodness is represented. This comes after initial visual analysis, but before subsequent decision stages, which apply a threshold to the analog LOC response.},

  abstract = {Humans are quicker to detect reflectional than rotational or translational symmetry, despite the fact that these patterns are equally regular. We were interested in the neural correlates of these perceptual effects. Participants viewed random, reflection, rotation, and translation patterns while we recorded EEG from the scalp. Half the participants classified the pattern regularity overtly, the other half did not explicitly attend to pattern regularity but reported rare oddball trials, where two squares were embedded among the dots. The amplitude of a symmetry-related ERP known as the sustained posterior negativity was most pronounced for reflection, then rotation and translation. We suggest that reflectional symmetry, despite its biological significance, may not be processed by unique visual mechanisms, but instead it could be a preferred stimulus for a more general regularity-sensitive network in the extrastriate visual cortex.},

  abstract = {Symmetry detection is slow when patterns are distorted by perspective, perhaps due to a time-consuming normalization process, or because discrimination relies on remaining weaker regularities in the retinal image. Participants viewed symmetrical or random dot patterns, either in a frontoparallel or slanted plane (±50°). One group performed a color discrimination task, while another performed a regularity discrimination task. We measured a symmetry-related event-related potential (ERP), beginning around 300 ms. During color discrimination, the ERP was reduced for slanted patterns, indexing only the remaining retinal structure. During regularity discrimination, the same ERP was view invariant, and identical for frontoparallel or slanted presentation. We conclude that normalization occurs rapidly during active symmetry discrimination, while symmetry-sensitive networks respond only to regularity in the retinal image when people are attending to other features.},
