## Descriptions of how figures in manuscript were generated:

* **Figure 1**
Created using Keynote (figure1.key) based on the images found in ./figures/figure1/wade_examples (adapted from Wade, 1993). 

* **Figure 2**
Created using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) by combining odd_occ_wave.pdf (generated using Matlab code - available upon request) and display_dur_boxplots.pdf (generated using ./analysis/disp_dur_plot_for_paper.R) with images found in ./figures/figure2/sym_examples
